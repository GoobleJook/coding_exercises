  <h1>Shelly Baer, <em>and you say I never send you cards...</em></h1>

<p>What this means to me is, you're the style to my structure, the color to my character(s), the beautiful design to my functional DOM.</p>

<p>You're my beauty; my light, my darkness; your unpredictable gradient continues to catch my eye; your rounded edges comfort my rigid lines.</p>

<span style="color: #BC3440">Love you!</span>
