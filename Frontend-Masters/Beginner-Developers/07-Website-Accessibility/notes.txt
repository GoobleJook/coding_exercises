Keyboard

Don't just make kepboard friendly; consider using keyboard shortcuts
  - examples: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit (other big social networks?) Google Mail(?)


Tabbable Items:
<a>
<button>
<input>
<select>
<textarea>
<iframe>

Make tabbable if not by default:
add tabindex property; 
  - <div tabindex="0">I can be focused</div>
  - Values of tabindex:
    - Negative value means that the element should be focusable, but not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation (used for JS).
    - 0 Means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but its relative order is defined by platform convention.
    - A positive value means it should be focusable and reacable via sequential keyboard navigation, its relative order is defined by the value of the attribute; the sequential follow the increasing order of the tabindex. If several elements share the same tabindex, their relative order follows their relative position in the document.
