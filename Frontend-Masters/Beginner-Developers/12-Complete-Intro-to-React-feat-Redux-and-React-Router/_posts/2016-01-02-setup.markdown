title:  "Setup"
---

In order to be able to complete this entire workshop, we need to go ahead and get some tools downloaded. Even better if you can complete this before the workshop since conference Wi-Fi is notoriously spotty.

## Clone the git repo

## node.js 4.3+

You _probably_ can complete this with something less than node 4.3 but that's what I'm using. Being the node.js LTS release, it's a safe bet to be using. If you need to use a different version of node for work, I strongly recommend using <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a>. I recommend getting the binary straight off the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node website</a> and _not_ using homebrew for installation.

## npm installs

Run <code>npm install</code> from the directory where you downloaded the repo. If you have node and npm installed, you should see a list of dependencies being installed.

## npm global installs

Run the following global npm installs

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g mocha
npm install -g nodemon
npm install -g webpack
npm install -g standard
{% endhighlight %}

We'll be using webpack v1.12, Mocha v2.4 and standard v6.0.
