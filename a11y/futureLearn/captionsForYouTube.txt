Hey Brenda, it's Robert Hernandez. I'm just sitting here playing around with 

captioning on YouTube and iMovie for a project with my accessibility stuff.

You always gotta be learning, right?

I hope your day at work wasn't too hard, and I am eagerly anticipating

the time when we get to meet face to face, hopefully soon.

I figure we've probably talked enough, chatted enough. I like you and 

you seem to like me. There's only one thing missing: A kiss.

Your lips look lovely, and your dark blonde hair feels soft, I'd imagine.

I can imagine a lot of things.

I can imagine my strong hands on your soft skin. I can imagine

your eyes sparkling with excitement as I lean in. I imagine feeling

your heart hammer faster against my chest, as our phermones and

hormones get all mixed together. Imagination is fine, but

I bet your lips are one of the best things I've ever tasted, and

it kinda seems a shame to wait any longer. I hope to see you soon, Brenda.
