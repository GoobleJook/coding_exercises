	<h1>Brief Explanation of Floats</h1>
	<p>A floated element will be taken out of normal flow and will float to the left or the right, resting against one of three things:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The edge of the viewport</li>
		<li>The edge of the parent containter</li>
		<li>The edge of another floated item</li>
	</ol>
	<p>A float element has 4 possible values</p>
	<ol>
		<li>img { float: left; }</li>
		<li>img { float: right; }</li>
		<li>img { float: none; }</li>
		<li>img {	float: inherit; }</li>
	</ol>
	<p>How do floats interact with other elements?</p>
	<p>In the example of a <code>&ltimg&gt</code> block in the flow above a <code>&ltp&gt</code> block with text blocks in it, if the <code>&ltimg&gt</code> were floated to the left, the text would move up, and then form around the image, like so:</p>
	<img src="th.jpg" alt="Henry Rollins" style="float: left;">
	<p>Henry Rollins is a pretty fucking hardcore dude. He's done a lot of shit. He sang for Black Flag and the Rollins Band, and he has acted, run his own publishing label, written, and played as a DJ. He's a cool mofo.</p>
