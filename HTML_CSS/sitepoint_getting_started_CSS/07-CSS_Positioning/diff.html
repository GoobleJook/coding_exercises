	<h1>Three key differences between absolute, relative, and fixed positioning</h1>
	
	<div>
		<h2 id="first_heading">What happens to the content after the element?</h2>
		<p><strong>Absolute: </strong>Content after the element will ignore the positioned element</p>
		<p><strong>Relative: </strong>Content after the element will leave space for the positioned element</p>
		<p><strong>Fixed: </strong>Content after the element will ignore the positioned element</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Do they have a width, or do they shrink-wrap?</h2>
		<p><strong>Absolute: </strong>Initially shrink-wrapped but can be sized or stretched</p>
		<p><strong>Relative: </strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>If they are block level, they will initially be stretched but they can be given size.</li>
				<li>If they are inline, they will initially be shrink-wrapped and cannot be given size.</li>
			</ul>
		<p><strong>Fixed: </strong>Initially shrink-wrapped but can be sized or stretched.</p>
	</div>	

	<div>
		<h2>What are they positioned against?</h2>
		<p><strong>Absolute: </strong>Positioned relative to a parent with positioning or viewport if no positioned parent is present.</p>
		<p><strong>Relative: </strong>Positioned relative to element's original position.</p>
		<p><strong>Fixed: </strong>Positioned relative to the viewport.</p>
