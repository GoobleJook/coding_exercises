Webpack commands:

Build for debug mode:
webpack js/ClientApp.js public/bundle.js

Build for Production:
NODE_ENV=production webpack -p js/ClientApp.js public/bundle.js


Babel commands (in development):
1. create .babelrc (a JSON file)
2. plugin and presets, presets are collections of plugins
2a. "modules": false for webpack so webpack bundles not babel, so uglify can strip out code (tree shaking)
2b. "loose": true -- makes it smaller because it leaves out crazy edge cases and uses only common polyfills
3. Only include plugins you need for production
4. webpack --module-bind='js=babel' js/ClientApp.js public/bundle.js
5. Write webpack.config.js in root
6. Can now just run webpack


To run webpack watch after this:
use either
webpack --watch 
or
npm run build -- --watch
