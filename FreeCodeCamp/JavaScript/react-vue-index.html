<!-- Let’s take a deeper look into how JSX works. Assume that you have a list of names that you want to display onto the DOM. A list of new hires that your company recently made.
If you were using plain HTML, you would first need to create an index.html file. Then you would add the following lines of code.
 -->

 <!-- HTML -->
 <!-- <ul>
   <li> Jordan </li>
   <li> Catherine </li>
   <li> Yoly </li>
   <li> Ezell </li>
 </ul>
 -->
 <!-- JSX -->
 <!-- So how would you do the same thing using JSX? The first step would be to create another index.html file. But instead of adding the full HTML like you did before, you’ll only add a simple div element. This div will be the container element where all your React code will be rendered.
The div will need to have a unique ID so that React knows where to find it. Facebook tends to favor the root keyword, so let’s stick with that. -->

<!-- Go to react-vue-app.js -->
<script src="./react-vue-app.js"></script>
