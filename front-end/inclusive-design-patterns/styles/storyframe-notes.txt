Storyframes:
  - look like a script
  - focus on heirachry and page structure, above layout or final copy

Example of Dropbox storyframe:
"Hi, we are Dropbox.
We are reinventing teamwork (and we keep releasing tools and software that proves that).

We are designed around the way you work.

You can take your docs anywhere -- whether it is your phone or on the road.

You can also upload videos pretty quickly and send to anyone (even if they don't use Dropbox).

You can manage your photos fairly easily too. We make it pretty simple to organize them.

And we also have tools for real-time collaboration with your peers, whether you are working together on a presentation or constantly updating files in a folder.

Of course, we're safe. You'll never lose a file again.

Interested? Get started now.

PS In case this is not what you are looking for, here are a few other things you can do."

Best Practices:
1. Start by writing it all down
  - Brain dump
  - Each paragrah is a module
  - Each sententce is an element that you will eventually add to design
  - "How would I explain to a frien, in a conversation or an email, this thing/topic/product/story I am trying to communicate?"
  - Time: ~ 15 minutes
2. Keep it short
  - Trim after brain dump, after break
  - Focus on what USERS need to know, and their context
3. Pay with multiple stories
  - How can you reorder elements to tell different stories?
  - Which verions sound more natural?
  - Swap paragraphs and/or reintroduce content removed in step 2.
4. Shop it around
  - It's a draft you share with your teams
  - Move onto to wireframes/mockups after stakeholder buy-in (understanding this is not the final version.)

  Wrapping up (questions to ask as you move onto the more traditional design part of the design process):
    - What is the best way of displaying this information?
    - Which parts of text can be grouped into modules?
    - Which parts of the story can be replaced with images, videoes, or short animations?
    - Which parts of the story can be complemented with those same resources.
    - Which specific proof points do you want to display to back up your arguments?
    - Which actions do you expect people to take after going through your page story?
