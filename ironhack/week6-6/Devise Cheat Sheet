Devise Cheat Sheet

Adding Devise to an existing project
1) Add devise to Gemfile
gem 'devise'

2) Run bundle install
$ bundle install

3) Restart your Rails server
Stop your server with Control + C
$ rails server

3) Run the first generate command
$ rails generate devise:install

4) Generate the Devise model
$ rails generate devise User

5) Before you migrate, edit the latest migration to add new fields.   
Migrations are located in the db/migrate/ folder
Migration files are ordered by date so the last one is the latest
create_table(:users) do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.string :phone
    t.text :bio
    # ...

6) Apply the new migration
$ rake db:migrate


Using Devise in your controllers and views

1) To force people to log in to see certain pages, add authenticate_user! to the beginning of the actions.
Actions are methods on your controller that render pages.
def new
    authenticate_user!
    # ...
end

To save yourself a lot of typing, you can use before_action on the controller to specify all the actions you want to apply authenticate_user! to.
class PostsController < ApplicationController
    before_action :authenticate_user!, [ "new", "create" ]
    # ...
 If you don't provide a list of actions, it applies authentication to every action
NEEDS clarification

OPTIONAL

remove registerable to avoid people adding accounts
