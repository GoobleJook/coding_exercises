# Create a class CarDealer which has an inventory of cars. We want to be able to quickly locate all Cars of a given brand to show them to customers.

# We should be able to get all the cars of a brand with
# car_dealer.cars("Ford")

# We also need a method to print the inventory in a form like
# Ford: Fiesta, Mustang
# Seat: Ibiza, Leon, Toledo
