					<h2>A dark comedy</h2>
					<p>"Shakes the Clown" is a very dark movie written and directed by Bobcat Goldwaithe. It's about a drunken party clown and his battles with alcohol, mimes, shitty, drunk friends and love.</p>
					<p>It starts off with Carol Brady (Florence Henderson) startting as a one-night stand who loves, oddly, drunken clowns, dreamingly claiming tha Shakes is "Her first clown..."</p>
					<p>Funny!</p>
