# Tuples are created not by parenthesis but by commas
# Generally they are seen created with parenthesis; however, they aren't necessary
# my_tup = (1,2,3) is the same as my_tup = 1,2,3
# or, since Python is expecting an iteratible, you can feed it
# my_tup = ([1,2,3]), which is the same as the above
