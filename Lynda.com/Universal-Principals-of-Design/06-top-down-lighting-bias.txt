"Putting your Design in the Best Possible Light"

EXAMPLE -- Lincoln Memorial:
- original lighting (from bottom) cast Lincoln's face in a ghostly fashion.
- French put in electric lights in the 1920's, which gave lighting he was seeking, and then he sent photos to the commission responsible for the memorial.
  - Lighting from the top-left gave the impression of "lowered, thoughtful brows"

DEFINITION: Top-down lighting bias:
Top-down lighting bias is the tendency to interpret objects as being lit from a single light source from above. It is found across all ranges and cultures. This likely results from humans evolving in an environment lit from above by the sun.

As a result of the bias, dark or shaded areas are interpreted as being farthest from the light source, and light areas are interpreted as closest.

Objects that are lighter at the top and darker at the bottom are interpreted to be convex.
