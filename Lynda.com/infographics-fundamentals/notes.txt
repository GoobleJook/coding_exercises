Motion Graphics:
- Can be simple (sliding off screen), or
- can be complex (changing the graphic on screen, usually with AI and Aftereffects)
- Can be better at conveying message than an infographic, especially for products and services (explainer videos can increase conversion by 87%)
  - If static, use images to tell story (posterboard). If a video (website), use narrator. Consider environment when creating.
  - Animated storyboards work well with narrator
  - GET SCRIPT, STORYBOARD, TIMING, AND ARTWORK APPROVED before you start implementing the project
